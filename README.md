## Types of Proxies Offered by Oxylabs (In Simple Terms)

Oxylabs offers a range of proxy services to support various web scraping and data-gathering requirements. Here’s an easy-to-understand breakdown of what they offer:

🚀Residential Proxies: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fc3eab5-a93e-449a-a48b-180c009a2a85)

These utilize IP addresses from real people’s devices, such as home computers or smartphones, supplied by internet service providers. Because they look like everyday users, they’re great for scraping websites or accessing content that’s limited to certain locations. Oxylabs has a massive pool of over 100 million IP addresses across 195 countries.

🚀 Datacenter Proxies: 

These proxies originate from powerful servers housed in data centers, not from real user devices. They’re super fast and more affordable, making them ideal for scraping large volumes of data. You can choose between shared or dedicated IP addresses—the latter provides full control and exclusive access.

🚀 Mobile Proxies: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92bf6754-3776-417f-909b-65e3cef3f00b)


These utilize IP addresses from real mobile devices connected to 3G, 4G, or 5G networks. Since they act like actual smartphone users, they’re perfect for mobile SEO tasks or checking how websites behave on phones. Oxylabs offers over 20 million mobile IPs in more than 140 countries.

🚀 ISP Proxies (also known as Static Residential Proxies): 

These combine the best of both worlds—speed and stability from data center proxies, with the authenticity of residential IPs. They're hosted in data centers but tied to internet providers, making them great for automation and long-running tasks.

🚀 SOCKS5 Proxies: 

These support the SOCKS5 protocol, which offers more flexibility than regular proxies. They work well for various types of internet traffic and offer stronger privacy and better compatibility for tasks such as file transfers or secure browsing.

🚀 HTTP/HTTPS Proxies: 

These are designed to handle regular web traffic. HTTPS proxies offer encryption, making them a solid choice for tasks involving sensitive or private data.

In addition to these features, Oxylabs offers handy features such as geo-targeting (down to the ZIP code), control over sessions (rotating or sticky IPs), and a Web Unblocker tool to bypass anti-bot systems. They also emphasize the ethical sourcing of their proxies and offer free trials, allowing you to test them out first.

## Is Your Data Safe with Oxylabs?

Yes, your data is generally secure when using Oxylabs. They employ robust protections, such as encryption (especially with HTTPS proxies), to safeguard your information during transmission.

Their residential and mobile proxies originate from real users who have given their explicit consent, ensuring compliance with key privacy laws such as the GDPR and CCPA. Since Oxylabs is located in Lithuania—an EU country with strict privacy regulations—they're held to high standards when it comes to data protection.

Oxylabs has built a solid reputation since 2015 for being transparent and trustworthy. Just remember, it’s essential to use their services properly and adhere to their rules. Avoid sharing sensitive personal data unless it’s truly necessary.
